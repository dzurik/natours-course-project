Natours

I wanted to get know more about nowadays trends about advanced css and sass and animations, so i decided to start a course from udemy about it.
I jumped in and this was the first time i met with the sass, and i just want to say, i love it. My next websites will be also created by sass.
This site was finished through the course to practice some new stuff.
